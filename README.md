# NgI18nTest

## This is a Translation Demo to show how it could be used for text in applications instead of conditionals

### Build i18n

Run `yarn extract-i18n`

Then look at the translation files to see if anything needs to be added.

### Run i18n

Run `yarn start-en-US`

Then go to the browser. You'll see the translations. Pretty cool stuff. Enjoy.

### Add more i18n
